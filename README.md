# Largest_Value

This program will generate a list of random numbers stored in a list, then compute the largest value in the list. 

After this, it will search for duplicates in the list, remove them, and count how many were present. 

In addition, computation time will be generated. 

Output will consist of:

Original list, the number of elements contained, and the average value

Processed list, the number of elements contained, and the average vaue

The Max value of the original list

Number of duplicates of the max value contained in the original list

Computation time of list processing
